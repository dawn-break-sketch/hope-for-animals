      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Hope for Animals was born out of heartbreak and hope. As the number of abandoned pets and mistreated animals grew in our communities, we knew we had to act. Families were giving up their dogs simply because they weren't sociable with children, or they were moving away and leaving them behind. These innocent animals were being left to suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many were found tied to trees in backyards, shivering in the rain or sweltering in the heat, often being fed only once a day—if at all. Malnourished, neglected, and voiceless, these animals deserved better. And so, our foundation was created: to give them a second chance at life, love, and dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we continue to rescue and rehabilitate both pets and farm animals—providing them with humane conditions, proper care, and the compassion they’ve always deserved.
